# Frontend Bootcamp Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **Frontend Bootcamp** documentation repo!
This repository contains all my notes, projects, exercises, and resources as I go through the bootcamp step by step.

## 📌 About

This repo is my personal learning log where I’ll track progress and build a solid foundation in frontend development.
The goal is to **master the essentials** and build real-world projects while documenting everything I learn.

## 🛠️ Topics Covered

Throughout the bootcamp, I’ll be covering:

* **HTML5** – Structure & semantics
* **CSS3** – Styling, layouts, Flexbox, Grid, animations
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Core concepts, DOM, events, functions, OOP, async
* **Version Control** – Git & GitHub workflow
* **Responsive Design** – Mobile-first, media queries
* **Frameworks & Libraries** – React (and possibly others)
* **Build Tools** – npm, Webpack/Vite, etc.
* **Projects** – Hands-on applications
